file encryption using java.security package and references from chatGPT<br>
1.when encrypting a password must be entered<br>
2.u cannot encrypt a file which is already encrypted<br>
3.decryption will ask for a password<br>
&emsp;3.1.if password is wrong no changes will occur<br>
&emsp;3.2.if password is correct decryption will occur<br>
4.encryption and decryption will perform correctly only is the Salt String is same for the both functions<br>
